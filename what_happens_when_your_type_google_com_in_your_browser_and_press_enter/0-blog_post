When you type https://www.google.com and hit Enter, many things happen behind the scenes:

Your browser checks its cache or asks a DNS resolver to find the IP address of www.google.com. This involves querying root, TLD, and authoritative DNS servers to get the correct IP.
With the IP address, a TCP connection is made using a three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) over IP. This establishes a reliable path to the server.
The request passes through firewalls on your device, network, and Google’s servers, ensuring traffic is safe and allowed.
An encrypted HTTPS connection is set up using SSL/TLS. Your browser verifies Google’s SSL certificate and establishes a secure channel to protect your data.
Google’s load balancer directs your request to the nearest or least-busy server to improve speed and reliability.
The web server receives the request, serves static files (if needed), or forwards the request to an application server.
The application server processes your request, applies business logic, and may interact with other services or a database.
If needed, the application server queries a database to retrieve or store information related to your request.
The response travels back through the same path, and your browser renders the page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Conclusion
This entire process—from DNS to database—happens in milliseconds and is key to how the modern web works. Understanding it helps you as a software engineer, regardless of your role.
